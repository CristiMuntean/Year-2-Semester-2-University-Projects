# Year-2-Semester-2-University-Projects
This repository contains the projects I worked on during the second semester of my second year of university
There are 4 projects in total, each meant to target a different topic and each of them contain their detailed documentation.


The first project is a polynomial calculator, aimed at helping us become more familiar with the MVC architectural pattern and regular expressions. I also created some simple unit tests in order to learn about how they work.

The second project is a queue management system. The app simulates how a given number of clients can go to a given number of queues and shows the distribution of the clients in real-time. During the development of this project I learned about threads and how to work with them in Java. I also learned about the synchronization mechanisms that are available in Java.

The third project is a order management system in which I learned how to work with local databases using Java and how to use the reflection technique. Also, during this project I learned about the layered architectural pattern by implementing it into the applicaiton. Starting from this project, there is also JavaDoc present.

The fourth project is a food delivery management system. In the time I worked on this project, I learned about serialization, about storing the information in files and retieving it when the application starts, about invariant methods, preconditions and postconditions and about working with lambda functions and streams.
